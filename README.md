This is a one pager helper to view your Flick images and generate links with images of different sizes to insert them into html.

Working page is hosted on github pages at https://dbagaev.github.io/flickr/

* You can select multiple images with Ctrl key, then you can add flex attribute to keep them nicely aligned
* You can use your own template with a few tags:
  - {url} - URL of current selected image size. Note that all images should have selected size on Flickr
  - {align} - add align property to the image, actually deprecated
